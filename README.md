# National Citizen Data Vault (NCDV)

A privacy-first digital public infrastructure for secure, consent-based aggregation of citizen data to enable evidence-based policymaking, research, and innovation.

---

## Overview

The **National Citizen Data Vault (NCDV)** is a conceptual and technical framework for a unified, cross-domain citizen data repository. It is designed to break data silos across public systems while preserving privacy, transparency, and citizen control.

NCDV enables governments, researchers, and innovators to responsibly use anonymized data for social impact, policy design, and digital innovation.
